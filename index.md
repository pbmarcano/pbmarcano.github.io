Hi &mdash; I&#39;m Pete Marcano, founder of [Rack5](http://www.rack5.co) and tech junkie since birth. I love creating simple solutions to complex problems, and making people's days a little better.

At Rack5 we're building [Key](http://www.rack5.co/key/) &mdash; a handsfree, zero-hassle password manager. Being secure online is as easy as carrying your phone in your pocket.

On the side I maintain a few side projects (and terrible domain names that seemed like good ideas at the time) to keep my knowledge and skillset fresh:

  * [Alt Hunt](http://www.althunt.com/), discover and listen to music that doesn't suck.
  * [Photos](http://photos.pbmarcano.com/), my personal online photo portfolio.
  * NotesTo, long-term note collecting from parents to kids.
  * [DoubleWrapped](http://www.doublewrapped.com/), a collection of burritos so large, one tortilla isn't enough.

I try to write essays on our [business blog](https://businessnbits.com) and on [this site](/essays/) frequently to teach what I learn.

Shoot me an email at [pbmarcano91@gmail.com](mailto:pbmarcano91@gmail.com), tweet me [@pbmarcano](https://twitter.com/pbmarcano), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/petermarcano/).
