<span class="intro">Hi — I'm Pete Marcano, founder of [Rack5](http://www.rack5.co) and tech junkie since birth. I love making people's days a little easier.</span>

At Rack5 we're building [Key](http://www.rack5.co/key/) — a handsfree, zero-hassle password manager. Being secure online is as easy as carrying your phone in your pocket.

I also maintain a few side projects (and terrible domain names that seemed like good ideas at the time) to keep my knowledge and skill set fresh:

* [Alt Hunt](http://www.althunt.com/), discover and listen to music that doesn't suck.
* [Photos](http://photos.pbmarcano.com/), my personal online photo portfolio.
* [Bounded.in](http://bounded.in/), long-term note collecting from parents to kids.
* [DoubleWrapped.com](http://www.doublewrapped.com/), a collection of burritos so large, one tortilla isn't enough.

I write essays on our [business blog](https://businessnbits.com) and on [this site](/essays/) occasionally to teach what I learn.

Shoot me an email at [pbmarcano91@gmail.com](mailto:pbmarcano91@gmail.com), tweet me [@pbmarcano](https://twitter.com/pbmarcano), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/petermarcano/).
