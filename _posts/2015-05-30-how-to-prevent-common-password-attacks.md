We all hate passwords. We can't remember them, we can barely trust them, and we frequently mistype them. Unfortunately for all of us living on the internet, we are stuck with password prompts everywhere we turn.

As internet consuming individuals we can't always guarantee that our passwords won't get compromised, but we do have the power to make ourselves considerably more secure online.

Here are 5 password hacks that you can be aware of and fix today:

### Brute Force
Ever hear someone tell you you need a password that is ridiculously long, must have special characters, numbers, capital and lowercase letters? Yeah, it's annoying. But there is a reason for that.

When I was a young kid I liked to hide my friend's bicycle around the neighborhood as a good ol' fashioned prank. One day he got a combination lock on his bicycle and I started guessing every combination possible from 000 to 999, one at a time.

Brute force attacks work in this kind of way. Hackers write special software that can guess thousands of combinations per second, some use dictionary words instead of letters, to crack your password.

Simple passwords, like "password" or "123456", are cracked in seconds. When your I.T. company wants you to use a password like "rue8y5+)Cv2=", it is because this password is so long and complex the computer will take several lifetimes in order to crack it.

Rule of thumb here, the more complex the password, the harder it is to brute force. The biggest problem creating a complex password is the ability to remember it. Psychologically speaking, we are only programmed to easily move about 7 digits or characters from our short term memory to long term memory.

### Password Reuse
While you may have a super secure password that can't be brute forced, it also isn't safe to use that password more than once.

Imagine each website you log into is an old medieval castle. Some castles have moats, guards, and countless other layers of protection operating 24 hours a day. Other castles and villages are more or less abandoned, have big holes in the sides of their walls, etc.

If you stored the same password in each castle, all a hacker would need to do is break into any castle (probably the least secure one), and use your password wherever you operate online.

The artists at XKCD made a [humorous little comic](https://xkcd.com/792/) about just this.

Reusing the same password everywhere you go is dangerous. Try to use as many different passwords as possible. Some suggest tiering their passwords, like using a general password for things like Facebook and forums, a more complex password for anywhere you may do online shopping, and a very complex password for high profile websites like bank accounts.


### Phishing
Not all password hacking attempts are technical in nature. Some hackers get your sensitive information offline by tricking you into handing it over. In the recent comedy Identity Thief, Melissa McCarthy's character calls Jason Bateman's character over the phone pretending to be the bank needing sensitive information to update his account information. When Jason Bateman gives Melissa McCarthy the information, she is able to run off with his identity.

This happens all the time. Emails get sent to employees pretending to be IT workers who need passwords to perform routine maintenance, and the ignorant employee forks it over.

Whenever someone asks you for a password, don't give it to them unless you are 100% sure their request is valid

### Shoulder Surfing
One of lowest tech password attacks. A hacker may steal a password by watching you type it. Fortunately, preventing crooks obtaining your password this way is not very difficult.

If someone is watching you intently while you use your computer, they may have motives beyond your handsome appearance.

Try and be mindful of your surroundings in public spaces and most importantly remember however simple this attack is, it can happen to anyone.

### Password Sniffing
A common and very effective type of password attack. Computers communicate by sending messages to each other across networks.

Other computers in the network will typically ignore any messages that are not meant for them. However there is plenty of software out there that makes it possible to display messages that are passing through the network. Including messages with sensitive information such as passwords.

Networks can use a variety of methods to prevent sniffing. The most common being encrypting the data broadcast across the network (SSL).

Virus scanners for all computers on the network might also be used. Sniffing becomes a larger problem the more users a network has, so be especially careful on open public networks such as coffee shops.

You wouldnâ€™t pass a note to someone with your bank details on it, so think carefully before performing the electronic equivalent.
