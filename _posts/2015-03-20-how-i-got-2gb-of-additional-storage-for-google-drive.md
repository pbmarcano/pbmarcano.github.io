It isn’t frequent when being secure online pays it’s dividends to us. Most of the time, when we change our passwords, or enable two factor authentication, it only makes life more inconvenient.

But that wasn’t the case this morning! This morning I got an email from Google that notified me that they had given me 2GB of additional Google Drive storage, free and permanently, for taking the time to go through their [Security Checkup](https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount)

Unfortunately for you reading this now,[this scheme](http://googledrive.blogspot.com/2015/02/safer-internet-day-2015.html)apparently ended on February 17th, 2015, but that doesn’t mean there is no benefits for getting a security checkup!

In fact, when I went through the checkup, I had no idea I was going to get the 2GB bonus. I did it because I take email security very seriously. As I [mentioned before](https://businessnbits.com/6-steps-to-a-safer-business/), email is essentially the sum of our online identity. Once someone is in our email, every other "protected website" can be accessed by clicking the “I forgot my password” link.

Either way, I’d like to show you quickly explain to you what each step of the [Google Security Checkup](https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount) covers, and why each step is important, in plain english.

Note: the Security Check only takes a few minutes, so I strongly encourage going through it.

### Checking Recovery Information
Recovery information is most commonly used in the event that you forget your email's password. If you are setting a password that you aren’t going to forget, I’d guess you are either Rain Man and can remember your super complicated password, or you may need to revisit it because it isn't too secure.

Either way, I recommend throwing in your mobile phone info (as it is unlikely to leave your side), and a secondary email account (which should also be secure!)

### Checking Recent Activity
This section covers all recent logins to your google account at different locations. It may include logging on from your phone, different web browsers, or different locations. Do a quick check and see if anything stands out. If it does, click “Something looks wrong” and change your password.

This is a neat way to check if someone else is currently or previously logged in to your account. If you are located in Colorado, and you see a current session in China… it may be time to change that password!

### Checking Your Account Permissions
Google allows you to use your Google Account to log into other sites and services, like your recent activity, see what applications you have granted access to your Google Account. If anything looks out of place or is outdated, revoke it’s access and continue to the next section.

### Checking Your App Passwords
If you have enabled two factor authentication (combining a password with a one time code on your phone), App Passwords are how you authenticate your Google account to those services that don’t support two factor authentication, like the Mail account on your iPhone.

Like your account permissions, check to see if anything looks out of place or is outdated, remove what is unnecessary and move onto the final section.

### Check Your Two Factor Authentication Settings
While inconvenient, two factor authentication makes it near impossible for a hacker to get into your account. Google offers text message services and a mobile app, [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en), to help you validate a secure login. If you have a smartphone, I strongly recommend the Authenticator application, it doesn’t require an internet connection and generates a new passcode every 30 seconds.

In the event that the phone you’ve installed google authenticator on is lost, google sets two factor backups… one being your primary phone number which hopefully is given to your new phone, and the other is a set of 10 printable codes (each code can only be used once) that can get you into your account.

Making sure these two factor settings are up to date will dramatically increase your security online.

Go through [Google’s Security Checkup](https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount) right now and tie up loose ends on your email security… it’s worth it, even if you don’t get the additional 2GB of Google Drive Storage (Hey! Stop being greedy! They give you 15GB to start with anyways!)
