### Part 1 of 5 (Planning)
I was recently reminded that this week is [Computer Science Education Week](http://csedweek.org/)! For those of you new to this idea, this week is dedicated to teaching people of all ages to code. This week is backed and supported by the likes of [Code.org](http://code.org) and their [Hour of Code](http://www.hourofcode.com) initiative.

*Hour of Code* encourages people from "ages 4 to 104" to sign up and learn how to write computer programs regardless of experience. Even U.S. President [Barack Obama](http://http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/12/08/celebrating-computer-science-education-week-kids-code-white-house), and companies like [Apple](http://www.apple.com/retail/code/) are joining the movement.

#### Where I fit in
Global initiatives like these excite me. While I started writing code earlier than most, computer programming was never taught in my primary or secondary education. I had learned HTML at about the age of 10 and C around the age of 17, but these skills were never valued in school, my family, or my social life, so developing them further didn't have obvious value... until I got to college.

Most of my real programming skills developed in college. When I recognized the potential of this skill set, I wanted to share it and teach others. I started tutoring other students in my spare time (something I still do, five years later), and encourage individuals to go to [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) to see just how easy it is to learn. I am thrilled that these days it has grown in popularity, became desirable for all employers, and is starting to be taught at a young age.

Unfortunately, these days I spend most of my time focusing on the business of [my new startup](http://www.keyauth.com), rather than the products themselves.

#### This week is different.
This week, I am joining millions of others to practice my programming, learn new things, and ultimately build the foundation of KeyAuth's initial product, **Key**. I have a lot of work to do, and like most good software products, I need to plan out my sprint well to avoid simple mistakes and decrease my development time.

### Wireframes and Features
If I suggested that you build a house without any blueprints, you would struggle to understand where to begin. It simply wouldn't make sense for a carpenter to start building something without a plan, so why should a software developer? Any good software developer wont just open the code editor blind. They typically have prepared some diagrams, user stories, or application templates to guide them along the way.

This week I am starting with the most basic functionality. Creating the User Interface template, and the user stories for basic "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations will give me a huge helping hand with starting the project, even if it is only sketched on paper or recorded on [Trello](http://www.trello.com). As more features need to be added, I can adjust enough later, the first version just needs to be usable, not perfect.

#### User stories
The objective here is to identify what is absolutely imperative to your users, in the form of "stories". Stories usually consist of these two key parts:

*As a **[user]**, I need to **[activity]**.*

By filling out this sentence, you are beginning to focus the features you build and whom you are building them for. In the Facebook team, a developer may have filled out the stories like this:

*As a **user**, I need to **share my mobile photos with my friends**.*

or

*As a **business**, I need to **promote my latest post outside my network**.*

Both of these user stories are specific to a user and highlight a feature that user needs. By constructing a handful of these, you are onto a great start. I have created a couple of these user stories for **Key**, and like I said earlier, they focus on CRUD functionality.

>As a **user**, I need to **create new and complex passwords for each website I log into**.

>As a **user**, I need **my passwords to be automatically filled (read) into the sign in form**.

>As a **user**, I need to **update my password to something more complex**.

>As a **user**, I need to **delete old accounts and passwords I will not be using anymore**.

These may not be enough for the first public release, but CRUD functionality can be found on almost any website with any database, so it is a good starting point for us. By focusing my efforts on core user stories like these, I can hope that within the month, even if **Key** isn't perfect, it will still be usable.

#### Wireframes
After these basic functionalities are identified, it is time to think about how your users will physically interact with your product. I personally like wireframes and paper prototypes. [Many](https://balsamiq.com/) [software](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) [tools](http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/visio/) exist to create these rough mockups, and they do the job well, but I am a sucker for pencil and paper.

I find when I use pencil and paper I can quickly sketch a button, label, or layout and physically walk it over to a prospective user and get feedback in real time. I find that many people will be nice to me if they feel that I put in a lot of work, but when they see something sketched on paper, they are more likely to say **"I think that button should go over here..."** or **"How the hell was I supposed to know that was the button I push?!"**... people may not always be nice, but honest feedback can only help you.

To do these sketches, you can use any old paper and pencil, but since I am a little bit of a neat-freak, I went over to [UIStencils](http://www.uistencils.com) and purchased a couple stencils to make more accurate diagrams.

After the sketches are made, I tested them against a couple of prospective users to make sure they can easily use the product, perform the required user stories, and iterate if necissary. When I am at the "good enough" stage, I progress onto my task for tomorrow... moving these layouts to my computer and onto the web and iPhone.
