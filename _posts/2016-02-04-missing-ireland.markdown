It's been a handful of months since I've left the Emerald Isle. In that time I've started to think about the little things that I took for granted, but now miss terribly.

Here they are:

1. **Going to the pub regularly is socially acceptable**. Apparently it's part of the Irish culture. Here, you're either in College or have a problem.
2. **Striking up random conversations with strangers.** People in Ireland were painfully nice. People outside the New York city area just aren't.
3. **Fearing for my life every time I get in a car.** Just like a game of Grand Theft Auto, cars can drive and park on sidewalks...
4. **Being able to fit all my cherished belongings in a couple of bags.** Knowing you're going to pack up your life and get on a plane forces you to live with less.
5. **Being fundamentally different**, yet never being treated like an outsider.
6. **Public transportation that doesn't suck.** Take notes, Lady Liberty.
7. **Exploring selections of sweets & chocolates I've never tasted before.** Cadbury... Flakes... Snack... Turkish?
8. **Knowing the difference between sweets & chocolates.** I've been so used to just calling everything "candy".
9. **Getting to see *films* in the *cinema* a full two weeks earlier than my American friends.** I guess european countries release some movies earlier than American countries.
10. **My awesome tiny apartment I rented in Cork City Centre.**
11. **Swapping the *er* with an *re* in words like *Centre***
12. **Drunk driving is significantly more unacceptable than it is in the States.** People here are comfortable having one or two before getting behind the wheel. Not the case in Ireland.
13. **Euro notes**. Different sizes and colors... So much easier to see in your wallet.
14. **Euro coins**. They go all the way up to €2!
15. **Being able to buy a full lunch with three €2 coins.**
16. **Internally debating if someone was legitimately talking about the weather, or just filling the awkward silence.** I'm still not sure.
17. **Never hearing debates about healthcare.**
18. **Never hearing debates about gun control.**
19. **Frequently hearing debates about water.**
20. **Whiskey.** Oh my god...
21. **The word *Craic***. Look it up.
22. **Food without preservatives.** Milk and bread expires in a couple days... who knew?
23. **Correctly saying *chips* and *crisps*.** After a while it came natural.
24. **Kerrygold.** Holy shit is that what butter is supposed to taste like?
25. **55 minute flights to London, for  less than €50.**
26. **Having "American" be a strong part of my identity.** Often the first thing I talked about when meeting new people.
27. **Being amazed that people who live 15 minutes from one another have different accents.**
28. **Not knowing what an Immersion is and wondering why I can't leave it on.** Still don't know.
29. **Never being sure if someone meant "Three" or "Tree".** "Thanks" and "Tanks" always gave me a chuckle too.
30. **Never needing to check the weather.** Just bring your umbrella.
31. **[Attending to a University that looks like Hogwarts.](https://www.google.com/search?q=ucc+campus&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR78jG1N7JAhUFeT4KHd7iBIMQ_AUICCgC&biw=1133&bih=801)**
32. **Never getting carded.** Apparently, I look "old as fuck" as one bouncer informed me.
33. **Never hearing rap music in any club.** Except *Fresh Prince of Bel Air*... because that shit is tight.
34. **Not being sure why everybody is calling each other "Ted".**
35. **Figuring out why everybody is calling each other "Ted".**
36. **Serial watching "Father Ted" on Netflix.**
37. **Having an entirely different Netflix library.**
38. **Chippers.** Lunch in a newspaper. 'nuff said.
39. **Figuring out what Gatt and Gaff meant all by myself.** Gatt means beer. Gaff means place or house. I have no idea how that started, but I'm proud that I'm down with the lingo.
40. **Learning that pre-drinking and drinking are actually the same thing**... despite the prefix "pre".
41. **Hot beverage addiction**. Irish people tend to drink lots of coffee and Tea. Coming off that caffeine addiction left me with a rough headache for a week.
42. **Cliffs of fucking Moher.** Scroll up. Can't see shit like that in the United States.
43. **Living out of my comfort zone.** Being homesick and not being able to do anything about it can test you. I had no idea.
44. **The difference between the Imperial Pint and the US Pint.** That additional 95ml of glory...
45. **All signs written in two languages.** It seems impressive to tourists, but everyone only reads the English part.

It was a fun couple years... and I already can't wait to go back.
